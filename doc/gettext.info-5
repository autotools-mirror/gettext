Organization
============

   On a larger scale, the true solution would be to organize some kind
of fairly precise set up in which volunteers could participate.  I gave
some thought to this idea lately, and realize there will be some touchy
points.  I thought of writing to Richard Stallman to launch such a
project, but feel it might be good to shake out the ideas between
ourselves first.  Most probably that Linux International has some
experience in the field already, or would like to orchestrate the
volunteer work, maybe.  Food for thought, in any case!

   I guess we have to setup something early, somehow, that will help
many possible contributors of the same language to interlock and avoid
work duplication, and further be put in contact for solving together
problems particular to their tongue (in most languages, there are many
difficulties peculiar to translating technical English).  My Swedish
contributor acknowledged these difficulties, and I'm well aware of them
for French.

   This is surely not a technical issue, but we should manage so the
effort of locale contributors be maximally useful, despite the national
team layer interface between contributors and maintainers.

   The Translation Project needs some setup for coordinating language
coordinators.  Localizing evolving programs will surely become a
permanent and continuous activity in the free software community, once
well started.  The setup should be minimally completed and tested
before GNU `gettext' becomes an official reality.  The e-mail address
`translation@iro.umontreal.ca' has been setup for receiving offers from
volunteers and general e-mail on these topics.  This address reaches
the Translation Project coordinator.

Central Coordination
--------------------

   I also think GNU will need sooner than it thinks, that someone setup
a way to organize and coordinate these groups.  Some kind of group of
groups.  My opinion is that it would be good that GNU delegates this
task to a small group of collaborating volunteers, shortly.  Perhaps in
`gnu.announce' a list of this national committee's can be published.

   My role as coordinator would simply be to refer to Ulrich any German
speaking volunteer interested to localization of free software
packages, and maybe helping national groups to initially organize,
while maintaining national registries for until national groups are
ready to take over.  In fact, the coordinator should ease volunteers to
get in contact with one another for creating national teams, which
should then select one coordinator per language, or country
(regionalized language).  If well done, the coordination should be
useful without being an overwhelming task, the time to put delegations
in place.

National Teams
--------------

   I suggest we look for volunteer coordinators/editors for individual
languages.  These people will scan contributions of translation files
for various programs, for their own languages, and will ensure high and
uniform standards of diction.

   From my current experience with other people in these days, those who
provide localizations are very enthusiastic about the process, and are
more interested in the localization process than in the program they
localize, and want to do many programs, not just one.  This seems to
confirm that having a coordinator/editor for each language is a good
idea.

   We need to choose someone who is good at writing clear and concise
prose in the language in question.  That is hard--we can't check it
ourselves.  So we need to ask a few people to judge each others'
writing and select the one who is best.

   I announce my prerelease to a few dozen people, and you would not
believe all the discussions it generated already.  I shudder to think
what will happen when this will be launched, for true, officially,
world wide.  Who am I to arbitrate between two Czekolsovak users
contradicting each other, for example?

   I assume that your German is not much better than my French so that
I would not be able to judge about these formulations.  What I would
suggest is that for each language there is a group for people who
maintain the PO files and judge about changes.  I suspect there will be
cultural differences between how such groups of people will behave.
Some will have relaxed ways, reach consensus easily, and have anyone of
the group relate to the maintainers, while others will fight to death,
organize heavy administrations up to national standards, and use strict
channels.

   The German team is putting out a good example.  Right now, they are
maybe half a dozen people revising translations of each other and
discussing the linguistic issues.  I do not even have all the names.
Ulrich Drepper is taking care of coordinating the German team.  He
subscribed to all my pretest lists, so I do not even have to warn him
specifically of incoming releases.

   I'm sure, that is a good idea to get teams for each language working
on translations. That will make the translations better and more
consistent.

Sub-Cultures
............

   Taking French for example, there are a few sub-cultures around
computers which developed diverging vocabularies.  Picking volunteers
here and there without addressing this problem in an organized way,
soon in the project, might produce a distasteful mix of
internationalized programs, and possibly trigger endless quarrels among
those who really care.

   Keeping some kind of unity in the way French localization of
internationalized programs is achieved is a difficult (and delicate)
job.  Knowing the latin character of French people (:-), if we take this
the wrong way, we could end up nowhere, or spoil a lot of energies.
Maybe we should begin to address this problem seriously _before_ GNU
`gettext' become officially published.  And I suspect that this means
soon!

Organizational Ideas
....................

   I expect the next big changes after the official release.  Please
note that I use the German translation of the short GPL message.  We
need to set a few good examples before the localization goes out for
true in the free software community.  Here are a few points to discuss:

   * Each group should have one FTP server (at least one master).

   * The files on the server should reflect the latest version (of
     course!) and it should also contain a RCS directory with the
     corresponding archives (I don't have this now).

   * There should also be a ChangeLog file (this is more useful than the
     RCS archive but can be generated automatically from the later by
     Emacs).

   * A "core group" should judge about questionable changes (for now
     this group consists solely by me but I ask some others
     occasionally; this also seems to work).

Mailing Lists
-------------

   If we get any inquiries about GNU `gettext', send them on to:

     `translation@iro.umontreal.ca'

   The `*-pretest' lists are quite useful to me, maybe the idea could
be generalized to many GNU, and non-GNU packages.  But each maintainer
his/her way!

   Franc,ois, we have a mechanism in place here at `gnu.ai.mit.edu' to
track teams, support mailing lists for them and log members.  We have a
slight preference that you use it.  If this is OK with you, I can get
you clued in.

   Things are changing!  A few years ago, when Daniel Fekete and I
asked for a mailing list for GNU localization, nested at the FSF, we
were politely invited to organize it anywhere else, and so did we.  For
communicating with my pretesters, I later made a handful of mailing
lists located at iro.umontreal.ca and administrated by `majordomo'.
These lists have been _very_ dependable so far...

   I suspect that the German team will organize itself a mailing list
located in Germany, and so forth for other countries.  But before they
organize for true, it could surely be useful to offer mailing lists
located at the FSF to each national team.  So yes, please explain me
how I should proceed to create and handle them.

   We should create temporary mailing lists, one per country, to help
people organize.  Temporary, because once regrouped and structured, it
would be fair the volunteers from country bring back _their_ list in
there and manage it as they want.  My feeling is that, in the long run,
each team should run its own list, from within their country.  There
also should be some central list to which all teams could subscribe as
they see fit, as long as each team is represented in it.

Information Flow
================

   There will surely be some discussion about this messages after the
packages are finally released.  If people now send you some proposals
for better messages, how do you proceed?  Jim, please note that right
now, as I put forward nearly a dozen of localizable programs, I receive
both the translations and the coordination concerns about them.

   If I put one of my things to pretest, Ulrich receives the
announcement and passes it on to the German team, who make last minute
revisions.  Then he submits the translation files to me _as the
maintainer_.  For free packages I do not maintain, I would not even
hear about it.  This scheme could be made to work for the whole
Translation Project, I think.  For security reasons, maybe Ulrich
(national coordinators, in fact) should update central registry kept at
the Translation Project (Jim, me, or Len's recruits) once in a while.

   In December/January, I was aggressively ready to internationalize
all of GNU, giving myself the duty of one small GNU package per week or
so, taking many weeks or months for bigger packages.  But it does not
work this way.  I first did all the things I'm responsible for.  I've
nothing against some missionary work on other maintainers, but I'm also
loosing a lot of energy over it--same debates over again.

   And when the first localized packages are released we'll get a lot of
responses about ugly translations :-).  Surely, and we need to have
beforehand a fairly good idea about how to handle the information flow
between the national teams and the package maintainers.

   Please start saving somewhere a quick history of each PO file.  I
know for sure that the file format will change, allowing for comments.
It would be nice that each file has a kind of log, and references for
those who want to submit comments or gripes, or otherwise contribute.
I sent a proposal for a fast and flexible format, but it is not
receiving acceptance yet by the GNU deciders.  I'll tell you when I
have more information about this.

The Maintainer's View
*********************

   The maintainer of a package has many responsibilities.  One of them
is ensuring that the package will install easily on many platforms, and
that the magic we described earlier (*note Users::) will work for
installers and end users.

   Of course, there are many possible ways by which GNU `gettext' might
be integrated in a distribution, and this chapter does not cover them
in all generality.  Instead, it details one possible approach which is
especially adequate for many free software distributions following GNU
standards, or even better, Gnits standards, because GNU `gettext' is
purposely for helping the internationalization of the whole GNU
project, and as many other good free packages as possible.  So, the
maintainer's view presented here presumes that the package already has
a `configure.in' file and uses GNU Autoconf.

   Nevertheless, GNU `gettext' may surely be useful for free packages
not following GNU standards and conventions, but the maintainers of such
packages might have to show imagination and initiative in organizing
their distributions so `gettext' work for them in all situations.
There are surely many, out there.

   Even if `gettext' methods are now stabilizing, slight adjustments
might be needed between successive `gettext' versions, so you should
ideally revise this chapter in subsequent releases, looking for changes.

Flat or Non-Flat Directory Structures
=====================================

   Some free software packages are distributed as `tar' files which
unpack in a single directory, these are said to be "flat" distributions.
Other free software packages have a one level hierarchy of
subdirectories, using for example a subdirectory named `doc/' for the
Texinfo manual and man pages, another called `lib/' for holding
functions meant to replace or complement C libraries, and a
subdirectory `src/' for holding the proper sources for the package.
These other distributions are said to be "non-flat".

   We cannot say much about flat distributions.  A flat directory
structure has the disadvantage of increasing the difficulty of updating
to a new version of GNU `gettext'.  Also, if you have many PO files,
this could somewhat pollute your single directory.  Also, GNU
`gettext''s libintl sources consist of C sources, shell scripts, `sed'
scripts and complicated Makefile rules, which don't fit well into an
existing flat structure.  For these reasons, we recommend to use
non-flat approach in this case as well.

   Maybe because GNU `gettext' itself has a non-flat structure, we have
more experience with this approach, and this is what will be described
in the remaining of this chapter.  Some maintainers might use this as
an opportunity to unflatten their package structure.


File: gettext.info,  Node: Prerequisites,  Next: gettextize Invocation,  Prev: Flat and Non-Flat,  Up: Maintainers

Prerequisite Works
==================

   There are some works which are required for using GNU `gettext' in
one of your package.  These works have some kind of generality that
escape the point by point descriptions used in the remainder of this
chapter.  So, we describe them here.

   * Before attempting to use `gettextize' you should install some
     other packages first.  Ensure that recent versions of GNU `m4',
     GNU Autoconf and GNU `gettext' are already installed at your site,
     and if not, proceed to do this first.  If you got to install these
     things, beware that GNU `m4' must be fully installed before GNU
     Autoconf is even _configured_.

     To further ease the task of a package maintainer the `automake'
     package was designed and implemented.  GNU `gettext' now uses this
     tool and the `Makefile's in the `intl/' and `po/' therefore know
     about all the goals necessary for using `automake' and `libintl'
     in one project.

     Those four packages are only needed to you, as a maintainer; the
     installers of your own package and end users do not really need
     any of GNU `m4', GNU Autoconf, GNU `gettext', or GNU `automake'
     for successfully installing and running your package, with messages
     properly translated.  But this is not completely true if you
     provide internationalized shell scripts within your own package:
     GNU `gettext' shall then be installed at the user site if the end
     users want to see the translation of shell script messages.

   * Your package should use Autoconf and have a `configure.in' file.
     If it does not, you have to learn how.  The Autoconf documentation
     is quite well written, it is a good idea that you print it and get
     familiar with it.

   * Your C sources should have already been modified according to
     instructions given earlier in this manual.  *Note Sources::.

   * Your `po/' directory should receive all PO files submitted to you
     by the translator teams, each having `LL.po' as a name.  This is
     not usually easy to get translation work done before your package
     gets internationalized and available!  Since the cycle has to
     start somewhere, the easiest for the maintainer is to start with
     absolutely no PO files, and wait until various translator teams
     get interested in your package, and submit PO files.


   It is worth adding here a few words about how the maintainer should
ideally behave with PO files submissions.  As a maintainer, your role is
to authentify the origin of the submission as being the representative
of the appropriate translating teams of the Translation Project (forward
the submission to `translation@iro.umontreal.ca' in case of doubt), to
ensure that the PO file format is not severely broken and does not
prevent successful installation, and for the rest, to merely to put
these PO files in `po/' for distribution.

   As a maintainer, you do not have to take on your shoulders the
responsibility of checking if the translations are adequate or
complete, and should avoid diving into linguistic matters.  Translation
teams drive themselves and are fully responsible of their linguistic
choices for the Translation Project.  Keep in mind that translator
teams are _not_ driven by maintainers.  You can help by carefully
redirecting all communications and reports from users about linguistic
matters to the appropriate translation team, or explain users how to
reach or join their team.  The simplest might be to send them the
`ABOUT-NLS' file.

   Maintainers should _never ever_ apply PO file bug reports
themselves, short-cutting translation teams.  If some translator has
difficulty to get some of her points through her team, it should not be
an issue for her to directly negotiate translations with maintainers.
Teams ought to settle their problems themselves, if any.  If you, as a
maintainer, ever think there is a real problem with a team, please
never try to _solve_ a team's problem on your own.


File: gettext.info,  Node: gettextize Invocation,  Next: Adjusting Files,  Prev: Prerequisites,  Up: Maintainers

Invoking the `gettextize' Program
=================================

   Some files are consistently and identically needed in every package
internationalized through GNU `gettext'.  As a matter of convenience,
the `gettextize' program puts all these files right in your package.
This program has the following synopsis:

     gettextize [ OPTION... ] [ DIRECTORY ]

and accepts the following options:

`-c'
`--copy'
     Copy the needed files instead of making symbolic links.  Using
     links would allow the package to always use the latest `gettext'
     code available on the system, but it might disturb some mechanism
     the maintainer is used to apply to the sources.  Because running
     `gettextize' is easy there shouldn't be problems with using copies.

`-f'
`--force'
     Force replacement of files which already exist.

`-h'
`--help'
     Display this help and exit.

`--version'
     Output version information and exit.

   If DIRECTORY is given, this is the top level directory of a package
to prepare for using GNU `gettext'.  If not given, it is assumed that
the current directory is the top level directory of such a package.

   The program `gettextize' provides the following files.  However, no
existing file will be replaced unless the option `--force' (`-f') is
specified.

  1. The `ABOUT-NLS' file is copied in the main directory of your
     package, the one being at the top level.  This file gives the main
     indications about how to install and use the Native Language
     Support features of your program.  You might elect to use a more
     recent copy of this `ABOUT-NLS' file than the one provided through
     `gettextize', if you have one handy.  You may also fetch a more
     recent copy of file `ABOUT-NLS' from Translation Project sites,
     and from most GNU archive sites.

  2. A `po/' directory is created for eventually holding all
     translation files, but initially only containing the file
     `po/Makefile.in.in' from the GNU `gettext' distribution.  (beware
     the double `.in' in the file name). If the `po/' directory already
     exists, it will be preserved along with the files it contains, and
     only `Makefile.in.in' will be overwritten.

  3. A `intl/' directory is created and filled with most of the files
     originally in the `intl/' directory of the GNU `gettext'
     distribution.  Also, if option `--force' (`-f') is given, the
     `intl/' directory is emptied first.


   If your site support symbolic links, `gettextize' will not actually
copy the files into your package, but establish symbolic links instead.
This avoids duplicating the disk space needed in all packages.  Merely
using the `-h' option while creating the `tar' archive of your
distribution will resolve each link by an actual copy in the
distribution archive.  So, to insist, you really should use `-h' option
with `tar' within your `dist' goal of your main `Makefile.in'.

   It is interesting to understand that most new files for supporting
GNU `gettext' facilities in one package go in `intl/' and `po/'
subdirectories.  One distinction between these two directories is that
`intl/' is meant to be completely identical in all packages using GNU
`gettext', while all newly created files, which have to be different,
go into `po/'.  There is a common `Makefile.in.in' in `po/', because
the `po/' directory needs its own `Makefile', and it has been designed
so it can be identical in all packages.

Files You Must Create or Alter
==============================

   Besides files which are automatically added through `gettextize',
there are many files needing revision for properly interacting with GNU
`gettext'.  If you are closely following GNU standards for Makefile
engineering and auto-configuration, the adaptations should be easier to
achieve.  Here is a point by point description of the changes needed in
each.

   So, here comes a list of files, each one followed by a description of
all alterations it needs.  Many examples are taken out from the GNU
`gettext' 0.10.39 distribution itself.  You may indeed refer to the
source code of the GNU `gettext' package, as it is intended to be a
good example and master implementation for using its own functionality.

File: gettext.info,  Node: po/POTFILES.in,  Next: configure.in,  Prev: Adjusting Files,  Up: Adjusting Files

`POTFILES.in' in `po/'
----------------------

   The `po/' directory should receive a file named `POTFILES.in'.  This
file tells which files, among all program sources, have marked strings
needing translation.  Here is an example of such a file:

     # List of source files containing translatable strings.
     # Copyright (C) 1995 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     
     # Common library files
     lib/error.c
     lib/getopt.c
     lib/xmalloc.c
     
     # Package source files
     src/gettext.c
     src/msgfmt.c
     src/xgettext.c

Hash-marked comments and white lines are ignored.  All other lines list
those source files containing strings marked for translation (*note
Mark Keywords::), in a notation relative to the top level of your whole
distribution, rather than the location of the `POTFILES.in' file itself.


File: gettext.info,  Node: configure.in,  Next: config.guess,  Prev: po/POTFILES.in,  Up: Adjusting Files

`configure.in' at top level
---------------------------

  1. Declare the package and version.

     This is done by a set of lines like these:

          PACKAGE=gettext
          VERSION=0.10.39
          AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED(PACKAGE, "$PACKAGE")
          AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED(VERSION, "$VERSION")
          AC_SUBST(PACKAGE)
          AC_SUBST(VERSION)

     Of course, you replace `gettext' with the name of your package,
     and `0.10.39' by its version numbers, exactly as they should
     appear in the packaged `tar' file name of your distribution
     (`gettext-0.10.39.tar.gz', here).

  2. Declare the available translations.

     This is done by defining `ALL_LINGUAS' to the white separated,
     quoted list of available languages, in a single line, like this:

          ALL_LINGUAS="de fr"

     This example means that German and French PO files are available,
     so that these languages are currently supported by your package.
     If you want to further restrict, at installation time, the set of
     installed languages, this should not be done by modifying
     `ALL_LINGUAS' in `configure.in', but rather by using the `LINGUAS'
     environment variable (*note Installers::).

  3. Check for internationalization support.

     Here is the main `m4' macro for triggering internationalization
     support.  Just add this line to `configure.in':

          AM_GNU_GETTEXT

     This call is purposely simple, even if it generates a lot of
     configure time checking and actions.

  4. Have output files created.

     The `AC_OUTPUT' directive, at the end of your `configure.in' file,
     needs to be modified in two ways:

          AC_OUTPUT([EXISTING CONFIGURATION FILES intl/Makefile po/Makefile.in],
          EXISTING ADDITIONAL ACTIONS])

     The modification to the first argument to `AC_OUTPUT' asks for
     substitution in the `intl/' and `po/' directories.  Note the `.in'
     suffix used for `po/' only.  This is because the distributed file
     is really `po/Makefile.in.in'.



File: gettext.info,  Node: config.guess,  Next: aclocal,  Prev: configure.in,  Up: Adjusting Files

`config.guess', `config.sub' at top level
-----------------------------------------

   You need to add the GNU `config.guess' and `config.sub' files to
your distribution.  They are needed because the `intl/' directory has
platform dependent support for determining the locale's character
encoding and therefore needs to identify the platform.

   You can obtain the newest version of `config.guess' and `config.sub'
from `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/config/'.  Less recent versions are
also contained in the GNU `automake' and GNU `libtool' packages.

   Normally, `config.guess' and `config.sub' are put at the top level
of a distribution.  But it is also possible to put them in a
subdirectory, altogether with other configuration support files like
`install-sh', `ltconfig', `ltmain.sh', `mkinstalldirs' or `missing'.
All you need to do, other than moving the files, is to add the
following line to your `configure.in'.

     AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([SUBDIR])


File: gettext.info,  Node: aclocal,  Next: acconfig,  Prev: config.guess,  Up: Adjusting Files

`aclocal.m4' at top level
-------------------------

   If you do not have an `aclocal.m4' file in your distribution, the
simplest is to concatenate the files `codeset.m4', `gettext.m4',
`glibc21.m4', `iconv.m4', `isc-posix.m4', `lcmessage.m4', `progtest.m4'
from GNU `gettext''s `m4/' directory into a single file.

   If you already have an `aclocal.m4' file, then you will have to
merge the said macro files into your `aclocal.m4'.  Note that if you
are upgrading from a previous release of GNU `gettext', you should most
probably _replace_ the macros (`AM_GNU_GETTEXT', `AM_WITH_NLS', etc.),
as they usually change a little from one release of GNU `gettext' to
the next.  Their contents may vary as we get more experience with
strange systems out there.

   These macros check for the internationalization support functions
and related informations.  Hopefully, once stabilized, these macros
might be integrated in the standard Autoconf set, because this piece of
`m4' code will be the same for all projects using GNU `gettext'.

`acconfig.h' at top level
-------------------------

   Earlier GNU `gettext' releases required to put definitions for
`ENABLE_NLS', `HAVE_GETTEXT' and `HAVE_LC_MESSAGES', `HAVE_STPCPY',
`PACKAGE' and `VERSION' into an `acconfig.h' file.  This is not needed
any more; you can remove them from your `acconfig.h' file unless your
package uses them independently from the `intl/' directory.


File: gettext.info,  Node: Makefile,  Next: src/Makefile,  Prev: acconfig,  Up: Adjusting Files

`Makefile.in' at top level
--------------------------

   Here are a few modifications you need to make to your main, top-level
`Makefile.in' file.

  1. Add the following lines near the beginning of your `Makefile.in',
     so the `dist:' goal will work properly (as explained further down):

          PACKAGE = @PACKAGE@
          VERSION = @VERSION@

  2. Add file `ABOUT-NLS' to the `DISTFILES' definition, so the file
     gets distributed.

  3. Wherever you process subdirectories in your `Makefile.in', be sure
     you also process dir subdirectories `intl' and `po'.  Special
     rules in the `Makefiles' take care for the case where no
     internationalization is wanted.

     If you are using Makefiles, either generated by automake, or
     hand-written so they carefully follow the GNU coding standards,
     the effected goals for which the new subdirectories must be
     handled include `installdirs', `install', `uninstall', `clean',
     `distclean'.

     Here is an example of a canonical order of processing.  In this
     example, we also define `SUBDIRS' in `Makefile.in' for it to be
     further used in the `dist:' goal.

          SUBDIRS = doc intl lib src @POSUB@

     Note that you must arrange for `make' to descend into the `intl'
     directory before descending into other directories containing code
     which make use of the `libintl.h' header file.  For this reason,
     here we mention `intl' before `lib' and `src'.

     that you will have to adapt to your own package.

  4. A delicate point is the `dist:' goal, as both `intl/Makefile' and
     `po/Makefile' will later assume that the proper directory has been
     set up from the main `Makefile'.  Here is an example at what the
     `dist:' goal might look like:

          distdir = $(PACKAGE)-$(VERSION)
          dist: Makefile
          	rm -fr $(distdir)
          	mkdir $(distdir)
          	chmod 777 $(distdir)
          	for file in $(DISTFILES); do \
          	  ln $$file $(distdir) 2>/dev/null || cp -p $$file $(distdir); \
          	done
          	for subdir in $(SUBDIRS); do \
          	  mkdir $(distdir)/$$subdir || exit 1; \
          	  chmod 777 $(distdir)/$$subdir; \
          	  (cd $$subdir && $(MAKE) $@) || exit 1; \
          	done
          	tar chozf $(distdir).tar.gz $(distdir)
          	rm -fr $(distdir)



File: gettext.info,  Node: src/Makefile,  Prev: Makefile,  Up: Adjusting Files

`Makefile.in' in `src/'
-----------------------

   Some of the modifications made in the main `Makefile.in' will also
be needed in the `Makefile.in' from your package sources, which we
assume here to be in the `src/' subdirectory.  Here are all the
modifications needed in `src/Makefile.in':

  1. In view of the `dist:' goal, you should have these lines near the
     beginning of `src/Makefile.in':

          PACKAGE = @PACKAGE@
          VERSION = @VERSION@

  2. If not done already, you should guarantee that `top_srcdir' gets
     defined.  This will serve for `cpp' include files.  Just add the
     line:

          top_srcdir = @top_srcdir@

  3. You might also want to define `subdir' as `src', later allowing
     for almost uniform `dist:' goals in all your `Makefile.in'.  At
     list, the `dist:' goal below assume that you used:

          subdir = src

  4. The `main' function of your program will normally call
     `bindtextdomain' (see *note Triggering::), like this:

          bindtextdomain (PACKAGE, LOCALEDIR);

     To make LOCALEDIR known to the program, add the following lines to
     Makefile.in:

          datadir = @datadir@
          localedir = $(datadir)/locale
          DEFS = -DLOCALEDIR=\"$(localedir)\" @DEFS@

     Note that `@datadir@' defaults to `$(prefix)/share', thus
     `$(localedir)' defaults to `$(prefix)/share/locale'.

  5. You should ensure that the final linking will use `@INTLLIBS@' as
     a library.  An easy way to achieve this is to manage that it gets
     into `LIBS', like this:

          LIBS = @INTLLIBS@ @LIBS@

     In most packages internationalized with GNU `gettext', one will
     find a directory `lib/' in which a library containing some helper
     functions will be build.  (You need at least the few functions
     which the GNU `gettext' Library itself needs.)  However some of
     the functions in the `lib/' also give messages to the user which
     of course should be translated, too.  Taking care of this it is
     not enough to place the support library (say `libsupport.a') just
     between the `@INTLLIBS@' and `@LIBS@' in the above example.
     Instead one has to write this:

          LIBS = ../lib/libsupport.a @INTLLIBS@ ../lib/libsupport.a @LIBS@

  6. You should also ensure that directory `intl/' will be searched for
     C preprocessor include files in all circumstances.  So, you have to
     manage so both `-I../intl' and `-I$(top_srcdir)/intl' will be
     given to the C compiler.

  7. Your `dist:' goal has to conform with others.  Here is a
     reasonable definition for it:

          distdir = ../$(PACKAGE)-$(VERSION)/$(subdir)
          dist: Makefile $(DISTFILES)
          	for file in $(DISTFILES); do \
          	  ln $$file $(distdir) 2>/dev/null || cp -p $$file $(distdir); \
          	done

History of GNU `gettext'
========================

   Internationalization concerns and algorithms have been informally
and casually discussed for years in GNU, sometimes around GNU `libc',
maybe around the incoming `Hurd', or otherwise (nobody clearly
remembers).  And even then, when the work started for real, this was
somewhat independently of these previous discussions.

   This all began in July 1994, when Patrick D'Cruze had the idea and
initiative of internationalizing version 3.9.2 of GNU `fileutils'.  He
then asked Jim Meyering, the maintainer, how to get those changes
folded into an official release.  That first draft was full of
`#ifdef's and somewhat disconcerting, and Jim wanted to find nicer
ways.  Patrick and Jim shared some tries and experimentations in this
area.  Then, feeling that this might eventually have a deeper impact on
GNU, Jim wanted to know what standards were, and contacted Richard
Stallman, who very quickly and verbally described an overall design for
what was meant to become `glocale', at that time.

   Jim implemented `glocale' and got a lot of exhausting feedback from
Patrick and Richard, of course, but also from Mitchum DSouza (who wrote
a `catgets'-like package), Roland McGrath, maybe David MacKenzie,
Franc,ois Pinard, and Paul Eggert, all pushing and pulling in various
directions, not always compatible, to the extent that after a couple of
test releases, `glocale' was torn apart.

   While Jim took some distance and time and became dad for a second
time, Roland wanted to get GNU `libc' internationalized, and got Ulrich
Drepper involved in that project.  Instead of starting from `glocale',
Ulrich rewrote something from scratch, but more conformant to the set
of guidelines who emerged out of the `glocale' effort.  Then, Ulrich
got people from the previous forum to involve themselves into this new
project, and the switch from `glocale' to what was first named
`msgutils', renamed `nlsutils', and later `gettext', became officially
accepted by Richard in May 1995 or so.

   Let's summarize by saying that Ulrich Drepper wrote GNU `gettext' in
April 1995.  The first official release of the package, including PO
mode, occurred in July 1995, and was numbered 0.7.  Other people
contributed to the effort by providing a discussion forum around
Ulrich, writing little pieces of code, or testing.  These are quoted in
the `THANKS' file which comes with the GNU `gettext' distribution.

   While this was being done, Franc,ois adapted half a dozen of GNU
packages to `glocale' first, then later to `gettext', putting them in
pretest, so providing along the way an effective user environment for
fine tuning the evolving tools.  He also took the responsibility of
organizing and coordinating the Translation Project.  After nearly a
year of informal exchanges between people from many countries,
translator teams started to exist in May 1995, through the creation and
support by Patrick D'Cruze of twenty unmoderated mailing lists for that
many native languages, and two moderated lists: one for reaching all
teams at once, the other for reaching all willing maintainers of
internationalized free software packages.

   Franc,ois also wrote PO mode in June 1995 with the collaboration of
Greg McGary, as a kind of contribution to Ulrich's package.  He also
gave a hand with the GNU `gettext' Texinfo manual.
