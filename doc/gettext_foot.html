<P>In this manual, all mentions of Emacs
refers to either GNU Emacs or to XEmacs, which people sometimes call FSF
Emacs and Lucid Emacs, respectively.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="gettext_2.html#DOCF2">(2)</A></H3>
<P>This
limitation is not imposed by GNU <CODE>gettext</CODE>, but is for compatibility
with the <CODE>msgfmt</CODE> implementation on Solaris.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="gettext_9.html#DOCF3">(3)</A></H3>
<P>Some
system, eg Ultrix, don't have <CODE>LC_MESSAGES</CODE>.  Here we use a more or
less arbitrary value for it, namely 1729, the smallest positive integer
which can be represented in two different ways as the sum of two cubes.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT4" HREF="gettext_9.html#DOCF4">(4)</A></H3>
<P>When the system does not support <CODE>setlocale</CODE> its behavior
in setting the locale values is simulated by looking at the environment
variables.
