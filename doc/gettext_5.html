<H1><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="gettext_toc.html#TOC21">5  Creating a New PO File</A></H1>

<P>
When starting a new translation, the translator copies the
<TT>`<VAR>package</VAR>.pot'</TT> template file to a file called
<TT>`<VAR>LANG</VAR>.po'</TT>.  Then she modifies the initial comments and
the header entry of this file.

</P>
<P>
The initial comments "SOME DESCRIPTIVE TITLE", "YEAR" and
"FIRST AUTHOR &#60;EMAIL@ADDRESS&#62;, YEAR" ought to be replaced by sensible
information.  This can be done in any text editor; if Emacs is used
and it switched to PO mode automatically (because it has recognized
the file's suffix), you can disable it by typing <KBD>M-x fundamental-mode</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
Modifying the header entry can already be done using PO mode: in Emacs,
type <KBD>M-x po-mode RET</KBD> and then <KBD>RET</KBD> again to start editing the
entry.  You should fill in the following fields.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Project-Id-Version
<DD>
This is the name and version of the package.

<DT>POT-Creation-Date
<DD>
This has already been filled in by <CODE>xgettext</CODE>.

<DT>PO-Revision-Date
<DD>
You don't need to fill this in. It will be filled by the Emacs PO mode
when you save the file.

<DT>Last-Translator
<DD>
Fill in your name and email address (without double quotes).

<DT>Language-Team
<DD>
Fill in the English name of the language, and the email address of the
language team you are part of.

Before starting a translation, it is a good idea to get in touch with
your translation team, not only to make sure you don't do duplicated work,
but also to coordinate difficult linguistic issues.

In the Free Translation Project, each translation team has its own mailing
list.  The up-to-date list of teams can be found at the Free Translation
Project's homepage, <TT>`http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/HTML/'</TT>,
in the "National teams" area.

<DT>Content-Type
<DD>
Replace <SAMP>`CHARSET'</SAMP> with the character encoding used for your language,
in your locale, or UTF-8.  This field is needed for correct operation of the
<CODE>msgmerge</CODE> and <CODE>msgfmt</CODE> programs, as well as for users whose
locale's character encoding differs from yours (see section <A HREF="gettext_9.html#SEC49">9.2.4  How to specify the output character set <CODE>gettext</CODE> uses</A>).

You get the character encoding of your locale by running the shell command
<SAMP>`locale charmap'</SAMP>.  If the result is <SAMP>`C'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`ANSI_X3.4-1968'</SAMP>,
which is equivalent to <SAMP>`ASCII'</SAMP> (= <SAMP>`US-ASCII'</SAMP>), it means that your
locale is not correctly configured.  In this case, ask your translation
team which charset to use.  <SAMP>`ASCII'</SAMP> is not usable for any language
except Latin.

Because the PO files must be portable to operating systems with less advanced
internationalization facilities, the character encodings that can be used
are limited to those supported by both GNU <CODE>libc</CODE> and GNU
<CODE>libiconv</CODE>. These are:
<CODE>ASCII</CODE>, <CODE>ISO-8859-1</CODE>, <CODE>ISO-8859-2</CODE>, <CODE>ISO-8859-3</CODE>,
<CODE>ISO-8859-4</CODE>, <CODE>ISO-8859-5</CODE>, <CODE>ISO-8859-6</CODE>, <CODE>ISO-8859-7</CODE>,
<CODE>ISO-8859-8</CODE>, <CODE>ISO-8859-9</CODE>, <CODE>ISO-8859-13</CODE>, <CODE>ISO-8859-15</CODE>,
<CODE>KOI8-R</CODE>, <CODE>KOI8-U</CODE>, <CODE>CP850</CODE>, <CODE>CP866</CODE>, <CODE>CP874</CODE>,
<CODE>CP932</CODE>, <CODE>CP949</CODE>, <CODE>CP950</CODE>, <CODE>CP1250</CODE>, <CODE>CP1251</CODE>,
<CODE>CP1252</CODE>, <CODE>CP1253</CODE>, <CODE>CP1254</CODE>, <CODE>CP1255</CODE>, <CODE>CP1256</CODE>,
<CODE>CP1257</CODE>, <CODE>GB2312</CODE>, <CODE>EUC-JP</CODE>, <CODE>EUC-KR</CODE>, <CODE>EUC-TW</CODE>,
<CODE>BIG5</CODE>, <CODE>BIG5-HKSCS</CODE>, <CODE>GBK</CODE>, <CODE>GB18030</CODE>, <CODE>SHIFT_JIS</CODE>,
<CODE>JOHAB</CODE>, <CODE>TIS-620</CODE>, <CODE>VISCII</CODE>, <CODE>UTF-8</CODE>.

In the GNU system, the following encodings are frequently used for the
corresponding languages.

When single quote characters or double quote characters are used in
translations for your language, and your locale's encoding is one of the
ISO-8859-* charsets, it is best if you create your PO files in UTF-8
encoding, instead of your locale's encoding.  This is because in UTF-8
the real quote characters can be represented (single quote characters:
U+2018, U+2019, double quote characters: U+201C, U+201D), whereas none of
ISO-8859-* charsets has them all.  Users in UTF-8 locales will see the
real quote characters, whereas users in ISO-8859-* locales will see the
vertical apostrophe and the vertical double quote instead (because that's
what the character set conversion will transliterate them to).

To enter such quote characters under X11, you can change your keyboard
mapping using the <CODE>xmodmap</CODE> program.  The X11 names of the quote
characters are "leftsinglequotemark", "rightsinglequotemark",
"leftdoublequotemark", "rightdoublequotemark", "singlelowquotemark",
"doublelowquotemark".

Note that only recent versions of GNU Emacs support the UTF-8 encoding:
Emacs 20 with Mule-UCS, and Emacs 21.  As of January 2001, XEmacs doesn't
support the UTF-8 encoding.

The character encoding name can be written in either upper or lower case.
Usually upper case is preferred.

<DT>Content-Transfer-Encoding
<DD>
Set this to <CODE>8bit</CODE>.

<DT>Plural-Forms
<DD>
This field is optional.  It is only needed if the PO file has plural forms.
You can find them by searching for the <SAMP>`msgid_plural'</SAMP> keyword.  The
format of the plural forms field is described in section <A HREF="gettext_9.html#SEC50">9.2.5  Additional functions for plural forms</A>.
