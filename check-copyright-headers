# This script checks whether the files in the GNU gettext package
# have the required copyright headers resp. license notices.
#
# Copyright notices have two purposes:
#
#  1. They tell the people who obtain the package (as a git checkout,
#     source tarball, or binary package) what they are allowed to do
#     with it.
#
#  2. They provide the legal basis for suing people who infringe on
#     the copyright of the package (or part of it).  In particular,
#     they should prove that the infringer knew what they were doing
#     when they took a source file (or part of it) and used it in
#     a way that is not compliant with the license.
#
# For the purpose 1, a file COPYING at the top-level of the package
# and a reference to it in the main README are all that's needed.
#
# For the purpose 2, we put copyright notices in each file that we
# don't want to be abused of. See also the section "Copyright Notices"
# in the 'Information for maintainers of GNU software',
# <https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Copyright-Notices.html>.
#
# This script helps with purpose 2.  The input of this script is a
# source tarball, not a git checkout.  Rationale:
# - It is convenient to add files to a git repository, without having
#   to attach a copyright notice to it.
# - Files that we don't include in the source tarball are not so valuable
#   that we would like to sue infringers over them.
#
# We classify the files in several categories:
# - Source code that ends up being executed by end users (in source or
#   compiled form).  This is the most valuable one and needs copyright
#   notices.
# - Source of large documentation.  This is valuable too, and needs
#   copyright notices.
# - Source code of build infrastructure.
# - Files that contain convenience information for programmers and
#   packagers.
# The latter categories are not valuable enough to warrant sueing
# infringers.
#
# Not all files qualify for a copyright header.  Namely, since copyright
# applies to the expression of an idea (think roughly of the program as
# an art work), it makes no sense to attach a copyright header to a file
# which different programmers would write in the same way.  This includes
# tiny files, as well as files that contain only machine-generated data.
