Things we plan to do. Comments welcome.

- Respect the GNU standard targets in intl/Makefile.in and po/Makefile.in.in.

- Document bash-2.04's $"..." facility and the associated 2 environment
  variables.

- Document that gettext requires the LC_MESSAGES category (or LANGUAGE
  override) and LC_CTYPE category to be set correctly via setlocale.

- Merge clisp specific changes.

- Work towards integration with automake.

- Stop documenting AM_WITH_NLS. AM_GNU_GETTEXT is the right macro to use.

- Check the *.m4 macros with bleeding-edge autoconf & automake.

- Documentation: Distinguish more clearly between gettext/xgettext,
  the Translation Project for GNU packages, and the PO mode.

- Read Francois Pinard's gettext folder.

- Evaluate Francois Pinard's po-utils and xpot. Takeover? Merge? Refer to?

- Change bug report address to bug-gettext instead of bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org

- Split xgettext into a language dependent part and a language independent
  part.

- Document what it means to add gettext support to a programming/scripting
  language. Add support for Java.

- KDE wants a kind of gettext2("role","msg")  function whose key is the
  concatenation of "role" and "msg" but whose default value is only "msg".

- Ask EMX, cygwin, mingw32, pw people for testing.

- Add msvc Makefile.

- Look at Christian Gafton's msghack.

- Look at Christian Robottom Reis's manual:
  http://www.async.com.br/~kiko/gettext.html

- Check whether ../lib/libsupport.a @@INTLLIBS@@ @@LIBS@@ is sufficient (see
  gettext.texi:5083) on HP-UX 10.01 and other systems lacking alloca.

- Provide a way to merge two .po files, coming from different translators of
  the same pot file.

- KBabel:
  http://i18n.kde.org/translation-howto/gui-specialized-apps.html
  http://i18n.kde.org/tools/kbabel/

- New programs:

  msgconv [-t encoding] [-o file] [file]
  converts a PO file to another encoding, default UTF-8

  msgsed [-e expr ...] [-o file] [file]
  applies a SED script to all msgstrs.

  msguniq [--unique] [--repeated]
  extract unique/repeated msgids

  msggrep [-L] [-f filename ...] [-e expr ...] [-o file] [file]
  extract those messages belonging to a given list of files or matching
  one of the given regular expressions

  msgcat [-o file] [file ...]
  combines several PO files

  msgen [-o file] [file]
  fills all empty msgstrs with the msgid, marked fuzzy

- Rewrite doc node "Compendium", discuss functionality, then check
  implementation and add Karl's new tests.
