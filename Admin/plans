Things we plan to do. Comments welcome.

- For gcc: Making the .pot files is maintainer mode; otherwise building
  breaks for normal users which don't have all the source.

- Respect the GNU standard targets in intl/Makefile.in and po/Makefile.in.in.

- gettextize needs not copy intl/ChangeLog. Instead create an empty ChangeLog,
  so that "make distcheck" will not fail.

- Document bash-2.04's $"..." facility and the associated 2 environment
  variables.

- Document that gettext requires the LC_MESSAGES category (or LANGUAGE
  override) and LC_CTYPE category to be set correctly via setlocale.

- Merge clisp specific changes.

- Work towards integration with automake.

- Stop documenting AM_WITH_NLS. AM_GNU_GETTEXT is the right macro to use.

- Build also libintl.so, using libtool.

- Check the *.m4 macros with bleeding-edge autoconf & automake.

- Documentation: Distinguish more clearly between gettext/xgettext,
  the Translation Project for GNU packages, and the PO mode.

- Read Francois Pinard's gettext folder.

- Evaluate Francois Pinard's po-utils and xpot. Takeover? Merge? Refer to?

- Change bug report address to bug-gettext instead of bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org

- Split xgettext into a language dependent part and a language independent
  part.

- Add c-ctype.{h,c} to misc. Document setlocale, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES issues.

- Document what it means to add gettext support to a programming/scripting
  language. Add support for Java.

- The --width option shouldn't split multibyte characters and take into account
  the wcwidth of the characters.

- KDE wants a kind of gettext2("role","msg")  function whose key is the
  concatenation of "role" and "msg" but whose default value is only "msg".

- For cygwin: Call open() with O_BINARY.

- Ask EMX, cygwin, mingw32, pw people for testing.

- Add msvc Makefile.

- Look at Ben Bullock's manual: http://www.hayamasa.demon.co.uk/doc/gettext.texi
