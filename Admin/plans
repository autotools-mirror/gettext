Things we plan to do. Comments welcome.

- Documentation: Distinguish more clearly between gettext/xgettext,
  the Translation Project for GNU packages, and the PO mode.

- KDE wants a kind of gettext2("role","msg")  function whose key is the
  concatenation of "role" and "msg" but whose default value is only "msg".

- Look at Christian Robottom Reis's manual:
  http://www.async.com.br/~kiko/gettext.html

- KBabel:
  http://i18n.kde.org/translation-howto/gui-specialized-apps.html
  http://i18n.kde.org/tools/kbabel/

- Tool to help people to correct msgid strings:
  1. Program to move msgstr contents to msgid contents,
  2. Program to update the translations accordingly, much like msgmerge.

- Refer also to the GNOME translation project http://www.klid.dk/gnome/ ?

- Mention Qt linguist (part of Qt 3)

- Easier delivery of PO directory for maintainer! Add a target for incoming
  PO files

- Qt 3.0 compatibility:
  - .ts, .qph catalogs
  - .qm binary catalogs

- Add logging to libintl, in order to catch each of these problems:
>         - if the directory that was argument to bindtextdomain is usable
>         - what catalogs are installed there
>         - if the language , that is requested by LC_ALL or some other
>                 variable is really there ...
>         - if program tries to translate some message, it doesn't really know 
>                 if it really get translated ... And if requested more than 
>                 one language , you have no way to realize into what
>                 language, it had been really translated !!!!!!!

- msgdiff

- automake integration: Add to "make dist" an invocation of
  "intltool-update --maintain", parametrized through a few variables that
  specify
    - where to look for i18n files,
    - which file types are to be considered by i18n,
    - which files are explicitly not i18n (e.g. generated files like
      src/po-gram-gen.c)

- AC_SUBST([CONFIG_STATUS_DEPENDENCIES], ['$(top_srcdir)/version.sh'])

- Use #(mkdir_p) instead of $(mkinstalldirs) in 2006.
