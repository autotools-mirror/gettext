Things we plan to do. Comments welcome.

- Replace bash specific INSTALL with the generic one.

- Update lib/ with some files from fetish utils.

- Update other files from libtool-1.3.5 and autoconf-2.13.

- Restore lib/vasprintf.c.

- Document bash-2.04's $"..." facility and the associated 2 environment
  variables.

- Document that gettext requires the LC_MESSAGES category (or LANGUAGE
  override) and LC_CTYPE category to be set correctly via setlocale.

- Make sure put-ABOUT file and Admin/ directories are not distributed.

- Update documentation for plural features and bind_textdomain_codeset.

- Treatment of plurals in pot-files: Use the following pattern:
    msgid "a piece of cake" | "%d pieces of cake"
    msgstr "un morceau de gateau" | "%d morceaux de gateau" [ | more strings ]
  or the following:
    msgid "a piece of cake"
    msgstr0 "un morceau de gateau"
    msgstr1 "%d morceaux de gateau"

- Work towards integration with automake.

- Stop documenting AM_WITH_NLS. AM_GNU_GETTEXT is the right macro to use.

- Unify intlh.inst.in and libgettext.h.

- Build also libintl.so, using libtool.

- Check the *.m4 macros with bleeding-edge autoconf & automake.

Future:

- Remove support for catgets and Solaris gettext.
