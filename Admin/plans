Things we plan to do. Comments welcome.

- Document bash-2.04's $"..." facility and the associated 2 environment
  variables.

- Merge clisp specific changes.

- Documentation: Distinguish more clearly between gettext/xgettext,
  the Translation Project for GNU packages, and the PO mode.

- Read Francois Pinard's gettext folder.

- KDE wants a kind of gettext2("role","msg")  function whose key is the
  concatenation of "role" and "msg" but whose default value is only "msg".

- Look at Christian Robottom Reis's manual:
  http://www.async.com.br/~kiko/gettext.html

- Check whether ../lib/libsupport.a @@INTLLIBS@@ @@LIBS@@ is sufficient (see
  gettext.texi:5083) on HP-UX 10.01 and other systems lacking alloca.

- KBabel:
  http://i18n.kde.org/translation-howto/gui-specialized-apps.html
  http://i18n.kde.org/tools/kbabel/

- Rewrite doc node "Compendium", discuss functionality, then check
  implementation and add Karl's new tests.

- Tool to help people to correct msgid strings:
  1. Program to move msgstr contents to msgid contents,
  2. Program to update the translations accordingly, much like msgmerge.

- Check portability of coding-system-list, apparently not defined
  in XEmacs 20.4.

- Refer also to the GNOME translation project http://www.klid.dk/gnome/ ?

- Bug:

  > ke@tux:> msginit --locale=de_DE.ISO-8859-1 -i project.pot -o - \
  >            | grep charset
  > "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"

  Oh, this is a bug. If de_DE.ISO-8859-1 is installed, it should use
  ISO-8859-1, not UTF-8. If the locale is not installed, it should
  complain.

- Recommendations for --help messages:


. Try rip out common phrases all and everywhere.  These are good
candidates:

"      --help                     display this help and exit\n"
"      --version                  output version information and exit\n"

or:

"Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.\n"

'xgettext' is able to accumulate common messages or common parts of
messages and the translators has to translate those messages only once
when proper splitting took place.

. It's not okay to split sentences; this is a fatal error (please, split
at paragraph bounderies):

#: src/ptx.c:1972
#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n"
"it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n"
"the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)\n"
"any later version.\n"
"\n"
"This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n"
msgstr ""
