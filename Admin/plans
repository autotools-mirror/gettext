Things we plan to do. Comments welcome.

- Respect the GNU standard targets in intl/Makefile.in and po/Makefile.in.in.

- Document bash-2.04's $"..." facility and the associated 2 environment
  variables.

- Document that gettext requires the LC_MESSAGES category (or LANGUAGE
  override) and LC_CTYPE category to be set correctly via setlocale.

- Merge clisp specific changes.

- Work towards integration with automake.

- Stop documenting AM_WITH_NLS. AM_GNU_GETTEXT is the right macro to use.

- Check the *.m4 macros with bleeding-edge autoconf & automake.

- Documentation: Distinguish more clearly between gettext/xgettext,
  the Translation Project for GNU packages, and the PO mode.

- Read Francois Pinard's gettext folder.

- Change bug report address to bug-gettext instead of bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org

- Split xgettext into a language dependent part and a language independent
  part.

- Document what it means to add gettext support to a programming/scripting
  language.

- Add support for Java.

- KDE wants a kind of gettext2("role","msg")  function whose key is the
  concatenation of "role" and "msg" but whose default value is only "msg".

- Add msvc Makefile.

- Look at Christian Robottom Reis's manual:
  http://www.async.com.br/~kiko/gettext.html

- Check whether ../lib/libsupport.a @@INTLLIBS@@ @@LIBS@@ is sufficient (see
  gettext.texi:5083) on HP-UX 10.01 and other systems lacking alloca.

- KBabel:
  http://i18n.kde.org/translation-howto/gui-specialized-apps.html
  http://i18n.kde.org/tools/kbabel/

- New programs:

  msginit
  create initial PO file from POT file.

- Rewrite doc node "Compendium", discuss functionality, then check
  implementation and add Karl's new tests.

- Tool to help people to correct msgid strings:
  1. Program to move msgstr contents to msgid contents,
  2. Program to update the translations accordingly, much like msgmerge.

- Rewrite Hundhammer's check_po script in C using message.h.

- Check portability of coding-system-list, apparently not defined
  in XEmacs 20.4.
