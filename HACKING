Building off the Git repository
===============================

Access to the Git repository is described at
https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=gettext .

After fetching the sources from the Git repository, peek at the comments in
autogen.sh, then run
  ./autopull.sh
  ./autogen.sh
Then you can proceed with "./configure" as usual.

Each time you want to update the source, do not only "git pull".  Instead do
  git pull && ./autopull.sh
  ./autogen.sh


Continuous integration
======================

The package is built automatically, at regular intervals.  You find the latest
build results here:
  https://gitlab.com/gnu-gettext/ci-distcheck/pipelines
  https://gitlab.com/gnu-gettext/ci-distcheck/-/jobs?scope=finished


Submitting patches
==================

Patches should be sent to bug-gettext@gnu.org, the bug/feature mailing
list.  You can subscribe to the mailing list, or see the list
archives, by following links from
https://savannah.gnu.org/mail/?group=gettext .

To email a patch you can use a shell command like 'git format-patch -1'
to create a file, and then attach the file to your email.

GNU gettext development no longer stores descriptions of new changes
in ChangeLog files.  Instead, a single ChangeLog file is generated
from the commit messages when a release is prepared.  So changes you
commit should not touch any of the ChangeLog files in the repository,
but instead should contain the log entries in the commit message.

For the style of a ChangeLog entry, see the "Change Logs" section of
the GNU coding standards:

  https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Change-Logs.html
